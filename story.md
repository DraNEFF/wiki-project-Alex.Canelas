##### Once Upon a Time – Short Story



It was a quiet morning in Storybrooke. The mist hovered low over the streets, hiding the remnants of a town still waking from a strange, magical night. At Granny’s Diner, Emma Swan sipped her coffee, scanning the newspaper for any unusual happenings. Her instincts whispered that trouble was brewing, as it always did.



Outside, Henry Mills dashed toward her, waving a crumpled page from a fairy tale book. “Mom! Something’s wrong at the library! The magical portal is flickering again!” he shouted, eyes wide with concern.



Emma set down her cup. “Alright, let’s see what’s going on,” she said, already moving toward the library. Captain Hook followed close behind, his sword strapped to his back and a smirk on his face. “Lead the way, Savior,” he teased, though his eyes betrayed caution.



Inside the library, the air shimmered with unstable magic. Rumplestiltskin appeared from the shadows, his golden dagger glinting under the light. “I warned you, Emma,” he murmured. “The balance between worlds is fragile. One wrong move, and chaos reigns.”



At the same time, Regina Mills entered, her expression unreadable. “We don’t have time to argue,” she said, glancing at Henry. “We need to stabilize the portal before anyone else gets hurt.”



Suddenly, a dark swirl of energy burst from the portal. A figure emerged—Snow White, looking confused and alarmed, as if she had just stepped out of a dream. Beside her, Prince Charming held his sword ready, protecting her from the unpredictable magic.



Emma stepped forward, determination burning in her eyes. “We’ve faced worse before,” she said. “But we have to work together—everyone.”



With Rumplestiltskin’s guidance, Regina’s magic, Hook’s skill, and Henry’s knowledge of fairy tale lore, they combined their strengths. The portal began to stabilize, glowing brighter with each coordinated effort.



As the light faded, the group looked around. The town was safe… for now. Emma placed a hand on Henry’s shoulder. “Storybrooke may always be complicated, but as long as we face it together, nothing can truly defeat us.”



Snow White smiled softly at her daughter, and Prince Charming nodded in agreement. Even Regina allowed a small, rare smile. Rumplestiltskin vanished back into the shadows, his presence a constant reminder that magic always had its price—but so did hope.



Outside, the town bathed in sunlight. For now, the heroes and former villains alike shared a moment of peace, ready for whatever adventure would come next.
